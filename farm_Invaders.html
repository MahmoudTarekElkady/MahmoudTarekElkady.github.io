                <!-- Gameplay Overview -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Gameplay Overview</h3>
                <p>In *Farm Invaders*, you are a farmer fighting off waves of alien invaders while simultaneously planting crops, harvesting them for profit, and upgrading your farm. Each wave introduces new, tougher enemies, making it essential to manage both farming and combat effectively.</p>

                <!-- Alien Waves and Enemy Types -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Alien Waves and Enemy Types</h3>
                <p>As the game progresses, aliens will attack in waves. Each wave introduces tougher and more numerous enemies, making it important to balance farming and defense strategies:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-position: inside; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Basic Aliens</strong>: Move slowly, easy to defeat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flying Aliens</strong>: Move quickly, harder to hit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boss Aliens</strong>: Appear every few waves, requiring stronger weapons and strategy to defeat.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Economy and Upgrades -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Economy and Upgrades</h3>
                <p>Money is earned by selling crops and killing aliens. You can use this money to buy seeds, new weapons, or upgrade your farming and defensive tools. Key aspects of the economy include:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-position: inside; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Planting Seeds</strong>: Buy seeds to grow crops and harvest them for profit. Higher-tier crops take longer to grow but yield more money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: Starting with basic weapons like a shotgun, you can upgrade to machine guns, flamethrowers, and laser rifles. Weapons require ammo, which can be bought with in-game currency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Farm Upgrades</strong>: Invest in farm upgrades such as larger planting areas, faster-growing crops, or automated harvesting tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defensive Items</strong>: You can buy traps, fences, turrets, and other items to help protect your farm while you focus on farming.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Survival Strategy -->
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Survival Strategy</h3>
                <p>The key to surviving longer in *Farm Invaders* is managing your time and resources. Balancing farming tasks, upgrading your farm, and preparing for alien waves is essential for success. Some of the challenges you'll face include:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-position: inside; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Time Management</strong>: Spend too much time farming, and you may not have time to defend against alien waves. Spend too much time fighting, and you won't earn enough money to upgrade your farm or weapons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Resources</strong>: Weapons and ammo require money, and you need to balance spending between farming and defense. Some weapons are more efficient against specific alien types, making it essential to plan ahead.</li>
                </ul>
